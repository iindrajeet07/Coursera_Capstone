It is home to various ethnic groups such as Canadian, English, Chinese, Indian, Italian etc. It is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nToronto is an international center of business, finance and culture. The business and employment opportunities in Toronto leads to temporary or permanent immigration of many families. There is also a lot of internal migration from within Canada to Toronto. Reasons can be economic, arts, better standard of living, etc.\n\nMigrating to a new city is not a simple task. One has to consider multiple facets while choosing a neighborhood to settle ex: Proximity to schools, colleges, hospitals, banks, hotels, etc. These are some of the basic important factors which a person should consider whenever he/she tries to relocate to a new city.\n\nIn this report, we will focus on Indian families that are planning to move to the great city of Toronto.
